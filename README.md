# UnityToonShader
A Unity Shader Lab Script

I made the shader because there is no simple and easy to use shader from asset, most of them use additional texture for lightmap, color discretization, etc. 
This shader does not require any texture setup and can be used easily.

Copy the shader and apply it to any material

Example

Only Base Texture need to be set up, no need to add other texture


Standard Shader For Comparison
